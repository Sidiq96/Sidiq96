## üíº Projects

### Project 1: [Restaurant-tracker ](https://github.com/Sidiq96/restaurant-tracker)

Restaurant Tracker is a web application that allows users to explore local restaurants, particularly focusing on London. The application integrates the Mapbox to provide a 
dynamic and interactive map interface and uses Local business API to gather restaurant details.

### Project 2: [Weather-Dashboard](https://github.com/Sidiq96/Weather-Dashboard)

In this Challenge, I'll be creating an app that allows users to see the weather forecast for cities of their choosing. Server APIs allow developers to access their data and functionality by making requests with specific parameters to a URL. Developers are often tasked with retrieving data from another application's API and using it in the context of their own. 
The challenge is to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.
